Mental checksum (use this every time you add a subject)

If you’re unsure whether something belongs in subjects.yaml, ask:

“Is this about who the subject is or how to find its data?”

	•	Yes → subjects.yaml
	•	No, it’s about how a tool works → global schema / adapter
	•	No, it’s about API endpoints or auth → provider instance config
